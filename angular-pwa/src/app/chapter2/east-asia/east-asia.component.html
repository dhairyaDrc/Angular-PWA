    East Asia was the first region hit by the COVID‑19 pandemic. While containment measures were quickly
    deployed
    to safeguard lives, massive economic shocks were soon felt and supply chains, trade, and tourism were
    disrupted. Aggressive economic measures, such as expedited construction works, income guarantees, and cash
    transfers, managed to cushion some of the impacts, but economic prospects remained fluid throughout 2020.
    Policy measures announced in the region during 2020 totaled $2.7 trillion or 16.4% of regional gross domestic
    product. The economy of <a href="https://www.adb.org/countries/mongolia/main" target="_blank">Mongolia</a>, a
    country heavily dependent on external demand, continued to contract, while
    the economy of the <a href="https://www.adb.org/countries/prc/main" target="_blank">People’s Republic of
    China</a> (PRC) bounced back and registered growth of 2.3%.
    </p>
    <p>In 2020, ADB committed $371.3 million for sovereign operations in Mongolia, of which over 40% was for
    COVID‑19 support, and $34.9 million for nonsovereign operations. In the PRC, ADB committed $2 billion
    under
    sovereign operations and $450.2 million under nonsovereign operations (excluding B loans). Including technical
    assistance and special grants, ADB committed a total of $2.9 billion for sovereign and nonsovereign operations
    in the East Asia region, up by 9% from 2019.

    </p><p>ADB’s response to the COVID‑19 crisis in East Asia focused on immediate economic recovery and social
    protection for poor and vulnerable groups, while also addressing longer-term issues such as weak health
    systems. For Mongolia, ADB committed a $100 million countercyclical support loan for the COVID‑19 Rapid
    Response Program. For the PRC, where the private sector is more developed, ADB channeled $38.5 million through
    nonsovereign operations to ensure continued supply of essential medicines and natural gas in the city of Wuhan
    and other areas of Hubei province. The bank also provided support to the Government of the PRC to enhance
    preparedness for future pandemics by strengthening the country’s long-term health security.
    </p>
    <p>As the global recovery from the pandemic gathers pace, the economies of East Asia need to gradually return
    their attention to long-standing development challenges. The PRC’s path to a fully modernized economy requires
    new drivers of growth while addressing an aging population, income inequality, and the rural–urban divide.
    Measures to contain and reduce severe environmental degradation and pollution must be considered along with
    economic growth in reaching policy decisions, and additional initiatives are needed to protect the
    environment. The same scenario applies in Mongolia, where large-scale mining developments have led to
    competition for land and scarce water supplies. Mongolia’s quest for a more broad-based economy could help
    ensure sustainable inclusive growth and reduce macroeconomic instability.

    Addressing Remaining Poverty and<br>Reducing Inequalities
    </h4>
    <p>
    In line with ADB’s country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016–2020, ADB continued to support the PRC’s
    education sector to help promote inclusive economic growth. In November 2020, the bank committed a $100
    million loan to improve access to quality early childhood education in Shangrao municipality, a poor area of
    Jiangxi province. Using results-based lending, the program will make education more affordable for more than 3
    million disadvantaged children; establish standard competency frameworks for teachers, principals, and
    childcare staff; and develop models and mechanisms for improving the quality of early childhood education.
    </p>
    <p>Recognizing that the Yangtze River Basin still faces significant development and economic challenges, ADB
    committed a $100 million loan to Yunnan province in the PRC to enhance water resources and wastewater
    management. The project will improve the living standards of 127,015 residents (47% women) and 25,403
    low-income people living around the project area by reducing solid waste and water pollution in the Sayu River
    Basin. The project will create about 2,200 jobs.

    <p>In Mongolia, the bank committed $29.9 million as additional financing for an existing health project to
    upgrade key hospital facilities in Ulaanbaatar and other regions of the country. To help Mongolia’s poor and
    vulnerable cope with the impacts of the COVID‑19 pandemic, ADB committed a $26.4 million emergency
    assistance
    loan to expand food stamps and cash grants.
    </p>
    <p>ADB is also improving access to, and the quality of, mainstream education for children with disabilities in
    Mongolia. Through a $2 million grant from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR), the bank is supporting
    an inclusive education project to improve accessibility in schools and kindergartens by building ramps,
    modifying toilets, and installing railings and braille signage. The project will also provide specialized
    devices to students to promote alternative communication methods, while training teachers in inclusive
    culture, policies, and practices.
    </p>
    <h4 class="icon op2">
    Accelerating Progress<br>in Gender Equality
    </h4>
    <p>
    Promoting gender equality is a key focus of ADB’s work in East Asia. ADB promoted gender equality in 90% of
    its number of committed projects in the region during 2018–2020, up from 80% during 2017–2019.
    </p>
    <p>In August, ADB committed a $212.4 million loan for a technical and vocational education and training project
    in the Chongqing municipality of the PRC. Designed to provide industry-relevant and innovation-oriented
    skills, the project will enhance the employment prospects of women, and help them to participate in economic
    activities outside the home. The project will develop higher education institutions where female teachers and
    students will benefit from advanced learning facilities and new training opportunities, including for
    innovation and entrepreneurship. It will create direct employment for an estimated 151,522 people (42% women).
    </p>
    <p>In support of a broader strategy to reduce the burden of unpaid domestic work by women, ADB is incorporating
    gender perspectives into its infrastructure investments. For example, under ongoing work to reduce air
    pollution in the PRC, the bank committed a $294.6 million results-based lending program to help residential
    and commercial customers in Henan province switch fuel use from coal to gas. Women are expected to benefit
    from time savings from the gas distribution pipelines and gas stoves that will be installed once the project
    is completed. The program pays particular attention to changing the traditional behaviors of women in
    townships and villages where they largely still use coal or firewood: it incorporates clean fuel awareness
    campaigns to communicate the benefits of gas for cooking and heating.

    TACKLING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN MONGOLIA
    </h3>
    <p class="clickhere">

    </p>
    <p>
    In Mongolia, as in many other countries, the COVID‑19 crisis has caused a spike in domestic violence.
    Police
    and other support services report that phone calls to helplines increased by up to 30% during the first
    quarter of 2020, with women making up 93% of victims.
    </p>
    <p>Lockdowns made it hard for domestic-abuse victims to venture out for advice and counseling. Overloaded
    helplines, some unable to accommodate multiple calls, meant many people struggled to reach the right support
    services.
    </p>
    <p>A $400,000 ADB technical assistance grant is strengthening Mongolia’s national domestic violence response
    system by building chatbots into the websites of the National Center Against Violence and the National Legal
    Institute, making services available both day and, importantly, at night when women need help most. The
    funding is also being used for a multimedia communication campaign to boost abuse prevention and increase
    access to legal and psychosocial counseling.
    </p>
    <p>To guide decision-making, ADB is also helping the Government of Mongolia build a central database—including
    privacy protocols to protect identities—so all calls are documented, whether they come via the 107 domestic
    violence hotline, 102 police hotline, legal call center, nongovernment help websites, or chatbots. To help
    keep services operational during the pandemic, ADB is financing the procurement of personal protective
    equipment, first aid kits, and disinfection materials for police units, women’s shelters, and one-stop
    service centers across the country. Mobile ultrasound equipment is reducing the need for victims to go to
    medical centers during lockdowns.

    <h4 class="icon op3">
    Tackling Climate Change, Building<br>Climate and Disaster Resilience, and<br>Enhancing Environmental
    Sustainability
    </h4>
    <p>
    Reducing pollution, restoring ecological protection, and encouraging sustainable livelihoods were ADB’s
    environmental priorities in East Asia during 2020. ADB has remained committed to addressing climate change and
    disaster resilience in the PRC and Mongolia. Of the total number of projects committed in the region in 2020,
    70% included climate mitigation or adaptation components (compared to 74% in 2019). Total climate financing
    amounted to $924 million, from ADB’s own resources.
    </p>
    <p>As part of the Yangtze River Economic Belt Framework, ADB and the PRC signed investment projects that will
    enhance environmental sustainability and climate resilience, while improving living standards for people along
    the Yangtze River Basin. For instance, ADB committed $101.4 million to help revive the Xin’an River, an
    independent river system in the Yangtze River Economic Belt Framework. As well as building river embankments
    to mitigate flooding, the project will upgrade sewage and stormwater management facilities in the municipality
    of Huangshan and four adjacent county areas, providing 95% of the urban population with access to wastewater
    treatment services.
    </p>
    <p>As part of its private sector operations, ADB committed a CNY488 million nonsovereign loan to Citic Financial
    Leasing Co. Ltd to fund long-tenor leases of clean energy projects—a good financing solution for solar power
    equipment with a long operating life. The deal marks ADB’s first nonsovereign loan to support clean energy
    development in the PRC through leasing. It builds on the bank’s success in using leasing to support green
    transport in the country.

    Making Cities<br>More Livable
    </h4>
    <p>
    During 2020, ADB responded to the challenges of rapid urbanization in East Asia by helping to improve
    inefficient public transport systems, ensure access to clean water supply, and prevent flooding in urban areas
    by introducing integrated solutions that can be replicated in the region.
    </p>
    <p>In the PRC, the bank signed a $200 million sector development program (investment and policy loan) to help
    transform Xiangtan from a carbon-intensive, heavily polluting city to a low-carbon, resilient, smart, and
    livable city. The project will install medians and peak-hour bus priority lanes on more than 60 kilometers of
    urban roads, make bus stops safer, and provide digital bus information and improved walking and cycling
    facilities for seamless access. The program will benefit 100,000 residents (50% female and 2,000 low-income
    residents) and encourage behavior changes toward a lower-carbon lifestyle.

    New bus lanes have reduced commuting time in Yichang. ADB invested to help construct almost 24 kilometers of
    dedicated lanes where clean, modern, and fast-moving buses could cut through gridlock.
    </p>
    <p>
    A new bus rapid transit system is reducing traffic, pollution, and road accidents in Yichang, People’s
    Republic of China. With Yichang facing rapid urbanization, ADB contributed a loan of $150 million to help
    introduce a bus rapid transit (BRT) system and road network improvement. Nineteen bus lines have been in
    operation since 2016.
    </p>
    <p>Since the project’s completion, use of buses in Yichang has increased 149% with a passenger survey
    revealing that 38% of BRT users had made the switch from private vehicles and taxis.
    </p>
    <p>These changes in travel behavior, along with dedicated bicycle and pedestrian lanes and more training for
    bus drivers, have contributed to a substantial drop in traffic accidents and fatalities. Deaths from road
    accidents in the city have fallen by 85% over the past decade.
    </p>
    <p>Reduced traffic has also shortened journey times. Zhou QinHua takes her young daughter to school by bus.
    “Now we save 10 minutes each way,” she says. The BRT has contributed to emissions reductions that in 2019
    totaled 42,480 tons of CO2 equivalent.
    </p>
    </div>
    <p>As part of its private sector operations, ADB signed an $80 million loan with the Bank of Communications
    Financial Leasing Co. Ltd. to fund the lease of new-energy buses in the PRC. These buses, powered by batteries
    and fuel cells with zero direct emissions, will help promote sustainable public transport and reduce pollution
    and traffic congestion.
    </p>
    <p>ADB also committed a loan facility of $105.5 million in yuan equivalent to Shenzhen Water (Group) Co., Ltd.
    and Shenzhen Water and Environment Investment Group Co., Ltd. to promote climate and disaster-resilient smart
    urban water infrastructure. This supports the development of urban water infrastructure systems that replicate
    natural processes to soak up heavy rainfall and flooding and release stored water for reuse. It applies
    innovative smart solutions throughout the water value chain to reduce power consumption and water losses,
    improve operational efficiency, and enhance water quality. It will help deliver water sustainability and
    security, and transfer water management know-how from Shenzhen to third- and fourth-tier cities.

    </p><p>In Mongolia, ADB committed $44.7 million for the third tranche of an investment program to improve urban
    services and ger area development in Ulaanbaatar. The investment, which is expected to benefit around 840,000
    people, will help construct roads, flood protection channels, electricity cables, and water and sewerage
    pipelines. It will also improve schools, health-care centers, public spaces, and housing conditions.
    </p>
    <p>ADB committed to administer a project, financed by a $2 million grant from the JFPR, to pilot improved solid
    waste management and recycling in four secondary cities of Mongolia. The project will construct and install
    new landfills, build solid waste transfer stations and weighbridges, and remodel cargo containers into waste
    recycling shops.
    </p>
    <h4 class="icon op5">
    Promoting Rural Development<br>and Food Security
    </h4>
    <p>
    Agriculture has become a priority for growth in Mongolia, and ADB is helping accelerate economic
    diversification in the sector and create jobs. The bank committed a $40 million loan, cofinanced by the JFPR,
    to install efficient and climate-resilient irrigation systems that will improve vegetable production across
    about 7,000 hectares of land. A total of 3,458 households involved in vegetable farming are expected to
    benefit from this investment.
    </p>
    <p>To reinforce the vital wheat supply chain in Mongolia, ADB signed a nonsovereign loan of $15 million with
    Ulaanbaatar Flour Limited Liability Company and Tavan Bogd Foods Limited Liability Company to provide
    liquidity support for the two companies. The ADB financing helped sustain the livelihoods of thousands of
    Mongolian wheat farmers, farming and wheat-processing workers, and staff in retail outlets.
    </p>
    <p>In the PRC, ADB and Alibaba are preparing a joint study on the digitalization of food supply chains and waste
    management. A webinar on digitalization to strengthen food supply chains and reduce plastic and food waste
    gathered leading experts who shared international experiences and discussed the importance of public–private
    partnerships and digital technologies in rural vitalization and food systems.
    </p>
    <h4 class="icon op6">
    Strengthening Governance and<br>Institutional Capacity
    </h4>
    <p>
    Good governance and strong institutions are key to ensuring financial stability and responding swiftly to
    socioeconomic shocks. ADB prioritizes institutional development and capacity building as a critical part of
    its support to the PRC and Mongolia. Approximately 67% of sovereign and nonsovereign projects committed in
    East Asia in 2020 included support for improved governance and institutional capacity.
    </p>
    <p>In the PRC, ADB committed a $206.6 million loan for green finance in Hebei province, one of the country’s
    most polluted industrial regions. The loan will be provided to the Bank of Xingtai, a regional city commercial
    bank, to finance investments in areas such as biomass power generation, biofuel production, waste-to-energy
    initiatives, plastic replacement (e.g., biodegradable material production), green buildings, and
    environment-friendly upgrades to industrial production lines. The project will strengthen institutional
    capacity in green finance policy and risk management, and will serve as a business model for other cities and
    rural commercial banks in the PRC.
    </p>
    <h4 class="icon op7">
    Fostering Regional Cooperation<br>and Integration
    </h4>
    <p>
    ADB is supporting the <a href="https://www.carecprogram.org/" target="_blank">Central Asia Regional Economic
    Cooperation Program</a> corridor, which connects landlocked
    countries, including Mongolia, with markets in the rest of the world.
    </p>
    <p>As part of a multitranche financing facility, ADB committed a loan of $201.6 million under the first tranche
    to provide economic opportunities and improve living conditions for communities along the border between the
    Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in the PRC and Mongolia. The project will install a smart port management
    system in the Erenhot–Zamyn-Uud economic cooperation zone, build a customs supervision center at the Mandula
    port, and upgrade an international hospital in Erenhot. It is expected to provide employment and income
    opportunities for 2.95 million people in the Erenhot and Baotou municipalities of Mongolia.
    </p>
    <p>To maximize cross-border synergy, ADB is complementing regional support with another project in Mongolia. In
    July, ADB committed a $30.4 million loan to develop the Zamyn-Uud border port, between Mongolia and the PRC,
    as a free zone for economic cooperation. The project will establish a port-of-entry system in the free zone,
    allowing Mongolia to easily monitor, trace, and manage health-related risks in the movement of goods and
    people across the border.

    environmental project that will help clean up the Xin’an River in the PRC’s Anhui province. These knowledge

    provinces within the PRC as well as ADB developing member countries.

    <p>The <a href="https://rksi.adb.org/" target="_blank">Regional Knowledge Sharing Initiative (RKSI)</a>,
    coordinated by ADB and the PRC, organized 28 events with 14
    partners in 2020, benefiting over 2,400 participants and covering a multitude of topics, albeit with a strong
    focus on COVID‑19.
    </p>
    <p>The RKSI and the Center for International Knowledge on Development organized a webinar series to share the
    PRC’s COVID‑19 lessons and experiences with other ADB developing member countries. This was attended by
    over
    800 participants and livestreamed through a social media channel. In response to demand, the RKSI also
    produced informative videos on the PRC’s Health Code and quarantine experiences, which have been widely
    shared.
