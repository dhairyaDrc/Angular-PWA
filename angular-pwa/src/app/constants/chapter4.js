ADB quickly provided customized secure connection over the internet (VPN) for all offices and extra information technology (IT) equipment, including portable Wi-Fi devices, to enable staff to work from home. The bank also strengthened its vigilance against cyberattacks using protection, detection, and incident management tools. A new real-time IT monitoring system using bots creates early alerts on connectivity and other IT issues, saving time for staff working in nearly 70 countries, as well as money.",
