From the loss of life to the lingering social and economic ramifications of measures to contain the virus, the pandemic has affected everyone. In Asia and the Pacific, by December 2020, more than 17 million cases of the disease had been identified, having caused more than 295,000 deaths.",

    data:"ADB moved swiftly to deliver flexible support to its developing member countries (DMCs). The bank began refocusing existing projects in late January 2020, and in February provided grants and technical assistance to help governments meet emergency health needs, including for supplies and equipment. ADB also set up a rapid and flexible financing instrument called the COVID‑19 Pandemic Response Option, or CPRO, to help governments protect the poor and vulnerable groups. Additionally, it provided extra support for the private sector, including for trade and supply chains. As the scale of the crisis became clearer, in April ADB expanded its initial allocation for COVID‑19 response and made available up to $20 billion to help governments and the private sector meet emergency needs, provide short-term economic stimulus, and deliver longer-term assistance for sustainable recovery. Further help to secure vaccines followed.",

The increase was largely due to the bank’s pandemic support, which accounted for half of its total commitments.

COVID‑19 is estimated to have meant an extra 162 million people in the region living under the poverty line of $3.20 per day, and 78 million people in extreme poverty on under $1.90 per day. Recovery from the pandemic will require a renewed focus on inclusive economic growth to address both poverty and growing inequality.",

Although these measures varied in their severity, they were all designed to restrict mobility and human interaction, and a plunge in economic activity was the natural consequence. Tourism was particularly hard hit by extensive travel restrictions. To compound the problem, the economies of the region’s major trading partners also contracted sharply, reducing demand for exports.",

GDP is expected to have shrunk in most of the region’s individual economies while those that expanded will post lower growth rates than in previous years. Small tourism-driven economies like the Cook Islands, Fiji, Palau, and Vanuatu, for example, struggled: visitor arrivals in Fiji fell by over 80% in 2020 to their lowest annual total since 1970, while Palau experienced its first fiscal deficit in 10 years.
